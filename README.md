### Important Notes
```
#### Image src resolving

The src prop (and blank-src prop of <b-img-lazy>), out of the box, works only with absolute or fully-qualified-domain-name URLs. If you are using project assets as image sources you need the vue.config.js file with the settings here.
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
